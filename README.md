# Reasoning with o1 (DeepLearning.AI and OpenAI)

This repository contains resources and code examples for the course **Reasoning with o1**, a short course developed in collaboration with OpenAI and taught by Colin Jarvis, Head of AI Solutions at OpenAI. The course provides an in-depth understanding of OpenAI's o1 model, focusing on its applications in reasoning, coding, and image processing.

## Overview of the Course

The **Reasoning with o1** course explores the o1 model's capabilities in abstract reasoning tasks, including planning, coding, domain-specific reasoning (e.g., law and STEM), and image understanding. You will learn how to prompt and optimize applications using the o1 model, balancing performance, latency, and cost.

### Key Learnings:
- Understand the o1 model's unique abilities and best-use scenarios.
- Learn to effectively prompt o1 and optimize performance with meta-prompting techniques.
- Explore how o1 performs coding and vision reasoning tasks, including task delegation to smaller models.
- Build applications utilizing o1's reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.
